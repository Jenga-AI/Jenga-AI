JengaAI – AN African Multi-Task NLP Framework for National Security, Governance, and Sustainable Development
Kenya and Africa at large face an urgent need for AI systems that genuinely understand local languages, dialects, cultural nuances, code-switching, and emerging national security threats—while also reducing the high cost of AI development. Existing foreign NLP and AI models, trained on Western datasets, consistently misinterpret or completely miss critical linguistic signals such as “twende deal flani,” “kuna ma-assets,” “weka za chai,” “kizunguzungu” and thousands of socio-linguistic expressions deeply embedded in African communication. These expressions carry meaning vital for accurate threat detection, governance analytics, public sentiment classification, and secure digital communication.
As Kenya accelerates digital transformation across security, governance, finance, agriculture, and public service delivery through programs such as The Kenya Digital Economy Acceleration Project, this mismatch creates significant blind spots in national security monitoring, misinformation detection, cyber-intelligence, digital governance, and public policy intelligence. At the same time, Kenya and Africa continue to suffer from a shortage of AI infrastructure, costly experimentation cycles and limited access to adaptable development frameworks—hindering widespread innovation. These limitations produce serious consequences. In national security, foreign models often fail to correctly classify coded language used in criminal networks, extremist recruitment, financial fraud, and cybercrime operations. In governance and public policy, they lack the capacity to analyze Kenyan parliamentary documents, local dialect sentiment, informal citizen complaints, and multilingual discourse where English, Kiswahili, Sheng, and indigenous languages blend fluidly. In public service delivery, this results in poor classification accuracy, unreliable analytics, and missed signals that directly impact decision-making.
Compounding the problem is Africa’s high cost of AI development and experimentation, without a unified, affordable, and context-aware AI framework, Kenya risks continued dependence on foreign systems that embed bias, overlook key national security indicators, and fail to capture Africa’s linguistic richness. This dependency undermines digital sovereignty, weakens the accuracy of automated systems, and hinders the country’s ability to build resilient and trustworthy AI capabilities for the future and limits progress toward sustainable economic development and national security resilience.
This proposal introduces JengaAI, a disruptive multi-task NLP framework built for countering African problems. JengaAI enables any user—from high school students to data scientists, start-ups, and government analysts—to create custom NLP models for threat detection, cyber intelligence, neural translation, NER, classification, document understanding, and more. Its plug-and-play architecture, attention-fusion mechanisms, uncertainty-weighted task balancing, and African-context embeddings make it the first model development framework truly aligned with Kenya’s linguistic and cultural reality.
By enabling affordable, reproducible, and scalable multi-task experimentation, JengaAI democratizes NLP development, accelerates national innovation, strengthens digital sovereignty, and lays the foundation for Kenya’s AI-driven future in security, governance, and sustainable development.



 Jenga-AI: A Sustainable Business & Democratization Plan
TUJENGE AI YETU NA jENGAai

Vision & Mission

Vision: To be the leading platform for developing, deploying, and sharing AI solutions tailored for African languages and contexts.

Mission: To empower African developers, businesses, and institutions with accessible, context-aware AI. We are not just building a tool; we are building an ecosystem. The open-source framework is the foundation, while the business is built on top of it through value-added services.

 Target Audience

1.  Startups & SMEs: Local tech companies needing to integrate NLP features (e.g., sentiment analysis, NER) without the high cost of building from scratch.
2.  NGOs & Research Institutions: Organizations working on social good, governance, or development that need to analyze large volumes of text data but lack AI expertise.
3.  Government Agencies: Security, public policy, and healthcare bodies requiring specialized, private, and secure AI models.


 Revenue Streams & Service Offerings

This is a multi-tiered strategy that balances democratization with sustainability.

 A. The Jenga-AI Hub: Model Hosting & Deployment (SaaS Platform)

This is our core platform, envisioned as a "Hugging Face for the African context."

   Freemium Tier (The Democratization Engine):
      Offering: Free hosting and deployment for a limited number of public, community-built models. Users get a generous but capped number of API calls per month.
      Goal: Drives adoption, builds a vibrant community, creates a funnel for paid tiers, and directly serves the "democratizing" mission.

   Developer/Pro Tier (Monthly Subscription ~ Ksh3,000-Ksh6,000/month):
      Offering: Private model hosting, significantly higher API call limits, access to pre-trained premium models (e.g., a highly accurate Swahili sentiment model), and basic email/forum support.
      Goal: Caters to individual developers, small startups, and researchers who need more power and privacy.

   Enterprise Tier (Custom Pricing / Annual Contract):
      Offering: Everything in Pro, plus:
          Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) / On-Premise Deployment: For organizations like banks or government agencies that cannot use a public cloud.
          Service Level Agreements (SLAs): Guaranteed uptime and performance.
          Premium, Dedicated Support: Direct access to our engineering team.
          Custom Analytics Dashboards: Detailed insights into model performance and usage.
     Goal: High-value contracts that provide the primary revenue to sustain the entire platform.

 B. Jenga-AI Data Services (Project-Based Fees)

Data is the biggest moat and the biggest challenge in Africa. We can turn this into a service.

   Data Annotation & Augmentation:
      Offering: Provide expert data labeling services for African languages. We can employ local linguists and data specialists, creating jobs and building high-quality, proprietary datasets.
      Example: A Kenyan company wants to build a customer service bot that understands Sheng. They provide raw text; we provide the labeled, model-ready dataset.


   Synthetic Data Generation:
      Offering: For clients with highly sensitive data (e.g., medical, financial), we use our advanced models to generate high-quality, privacy-preserving synthetic data for them to train on.

 C. Professional Services & Consulting (High-Margin Services)

   Custom Solution Development:
      Offering: Our expert team uses the Jenga-AI framework to build and train bespoke multi-task models for specific enterprise needs.
      Example: A national security agency contracts us to build a unified model for real-time threat detection across 5 different local languages.

   Corporate Training & Workshops:
      Offering: We provide paid workshops to train data science teams at larger companies and government agencies on how to effectively use the Jenga-AI framework.
