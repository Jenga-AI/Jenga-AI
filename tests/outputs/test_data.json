The basic or the premium plan?\nActually, I'm not sure which one would be best for my needs. Could you please explain the key differences between them?\nCertainly! Our basic plan is suitable for light to moderate internet usage, such as emailing and browsing. On the other hand, our premium plan is ideal for heavy internet users who require faster speeds for tasks like streaming high-definition videos or online gaming.\nThank you for explaining that.
